VALUES ('930352', '8th & Roast', '615-730-8074','2108A 8th Ave S Nashville, TN 37204', '"It all started when…
childhood friends Ed and Q began meeting at a little coffee shop named 8th And Roast. As they laid plans to build their dream restaurant, the coffee shop became their unofficial headquarters.
Then, it happened – they fell in love… with coffee.
When the owners of their favorite unofficial headquarters offered them the opportunity to partner up, they jumped at the chance. 
Coming from a hospitality background, they realized a coffee shop is always more than just a coffee shop. At its best, it’s a third home, a place to feel welcomed, connected, and part of a larger community. 
Armed with a vision to make the shop all that it could be, they set out to make the best craft coffee experience imaginable. Connecting with a network of fair trade farmers from around the world, they became an active part of a global sustainability movement. Whenever possible, they partner directly with the producers to import straight from the source, bypassing the middle-men. 
So come by, say hi, enjoy a great cup of coffee, and tap into a growing community now in 2 locations in Nashville (and the airport).
